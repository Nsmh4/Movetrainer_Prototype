# Movetrainer_Prototype
# ♟️ MoveTrainer

MoveTrainer is a web-based chess opening trainer and repertoire builder designed to help players structure, train, and refine their opening repertoire.

Users can import PGN files, construct variation trees move-by-move, and train interactively on a dynamic chessboard with legal move validation.

This is my first full-scale web application project. While it is fully functional, there may still be bugs, edge cases, or unfinished refinements. The project will continue to evolve with performance improvements, UI adjustments, and additional features over time.
